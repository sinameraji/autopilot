# Aster API v1 and VM runbook

Aster is a native iOS client. Autopilot on the VM owns model credentials, prompts, tool execution, workspace roots, conversation history, approvals, and run lifecycle. The Aster API is a separate Bearer-authenticated control plane under `/api/v1`; it does not use the legacy `/prompt` or `/runs` contract.

## Security boundary

- Keep `autopilot serve` bound to `127.0.0.1:4096`. Do not open this port in Hetzner firewall/UFW and do not use Tailscale Funnel or a public reverse proxy.
- Development access uses an SSH local forward. Physical iPhone access requires a private tailnet (recommended: Tailscale Serve, not Funnel) plus an expiring, workspace-scoped Aster credential stored in the iOS Keychain. The current VM has no Tailscale installation/enrollment; Aster cannot reach it from a phone until the operator enrolls the VM and phone in the same tailnet.
- `/api/v1/*` requires `Authorization: Bearer aster_…`. Credentials are workspace-scoped, expire (default 30 days), are stored only as SHA-256 hashes, and can be revoked. Legacy routes keep their separate Basic auth.
- The API exposes only `read`, `write`, and `edit`; no shell, external job, browser, web, GitHub, or artifact-expansion tools. Reads/writes/edits resolve inside the conversation worktree, reject traversal/symlinks out of root, and block credential/VCS paths. `write` and `edit` require a per-action human approval.
- Provider credentials remain in the VM service environment/config. They are never sent to Aster or included in API responses/events. Provider-like secrets in turn text or proposed write arguments are rejected; assistant deltas are redacted defensively.
- Each conversation runs inside its own Hotcell microVM with no host network and no host filesystem. Model access is brokered by Hotcell's credential gateway with a per-conversation, per-model, spend-capped, TTL-bound egress token that is revoked on destroy. Prompts and file contents never appear in Hotcell exec commands or logs; control traffic uses fixed commands with request bodies passed through `0600` files inside the cell.

## Configure the Hotcell provider

Aster conversation cells require a Hotcell deployment reachable from the service. Set these on `autopilot.service` (conversation creation returns `503 hotcell_unavailable` without them):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_ENDPOINT` | Hotcell control API; HTTPS required unless loopback |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_API_KEY` | Hotcell API key (kept server-side only) |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_DRIVER` | `firecracker` or `applevz`; the container driver is refused |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_MEMORY_MB` | Per-cell memory (default 4096) |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_CPUS` | Per-cell vCPUs (default 2) |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_PIDS` | Per-cell PID limit (default 256) |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_SPEND_CAP_USD` | Per-conversation egress spend cap (default 10) |
| `AUTOPILOT_HOTCELL_TOKEN_TTL_MS` | Egress token TTL (default 24h) |

The provider fails closed: it refuses to create a cell if the Hotcell API auth is disabled, the configured microVM driver is unavailable, or the OpenRouter egress gateway is missing. Creation is label-adoptive: cells carry a stable `autopilot.conversation_id` label, and a retry after an uncertain create adopts the labeled cell instead of provisioning a duplicate.

## Configure server-owned workspaces and models

Create `/etc/autopilot/aster.json` (do not put credentials in it):

```json
{
  "models": ["moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"],
  "approvalTtlMs": 300000,
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "id": "default",
      "displayName": "Default workspace",
      "rootPath": "/var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default"
    }
  ]
}
```

`id` is the only workspace selector accepted from clients. The API never accepts a client-supplied cwd or filesystem path. Roots must be existing, non-overlapping directories; each workspace root must be a Git repository so its tracked tree can be seeded into the conversation cell at creation.

On the VM, provision the root for the dedicated service identity, seed an initial commit, and install the config as root-owned/read-only to the service:

```sh
sudo install -d -o autopilot -g autopilot -m 0700 /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default
sudo -u autopilot git -C /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default init --initial-branch=main
sudo -u autopilot git -C /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default config user.name "Autopilot"
sudo -u autopilot git -C /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default config user.email "autopilot@localhost"
printf '# Default workspace\n' | sudo -u autopilot tee /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default/README.md >/dev/null
sudo -u autopilot git -C /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default add README.md
sudo -u autopilot git -C /var/lib/autopilot/workspaces/default commit -m "Initialize workspace"
sudo chown root:autopilot /etc/autopilot
sudo chmod 0750 /etc/autopilot
sudo install -o root -g autopilot -m 0640 aster.json /etc/autopilot/aster.json
```

Set `AUTOPILOT_ASTER_CONFIG=/etc/autopilot/aster.json` in the existing `autopilot.service` `Environment=` entries, then `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart autopilot`. Do not change `--hostname 127.0.0.1` or open a port.

## Issue/revoke the iPhone credential

Create credentials as the service user so the CLI and daemon share the same private database:

```sh
sudo -u autopilot env HOME=/var/lib/autopilot AUTOPILOT_ASTER_CONFIG=/etc/autopilot/aster.json \
  /usr/bin/node /opt/autopilot/bin/autopilot.mjs aster token create \
  --name "Aster iPhone" --workspace default
```

The token is printed once. Import it into the iOS Keychain; never commit it, put it in a prompt, or paste it into chat. Revoke immediately if the phone is lost:

```sh
sudo -u autopilot env HOME=/var/lib/autopilot \
  /usr/bin/node /opt/autopilot/bin/autopilot.mjs aster token revoke <credential-id>
```

## Access paths

Development over SSH (works now):

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine -N -L 4096:127.0.0.1:4096 root@2.29.49.61
```

Then use `http://127.0.0.1:4096` with the scoped Bearer token. For a physical iPhone, enroll both VM and phone in the same approved Tailscale tailnet, then use **Tailscale Serve only** to proxy HTTPS to `http://127.0.0.1:4096`. Do not enable Funnel or change Autopilot’s loopback bind. Enrollment requires the operator to complete Tailscale’s interactive device authorization; it is not done by this code change.

## API contract

All paths below require the scoped Bearer credential. Unknown IDs outside the token’s workspace scope are returned as `404` to avoid disclosing their existence. JSON errors use `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`.

### Capabilities and discovery

`GET /api/v1/health`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "autopilot",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "serviceVersion": "1.5.0",
  "capabilities": ["workspaces", "conversations", "turns", "event-replay", "cancellation", "human-approvals"]
}
```

`GET /api/v1/workspaces` returns only configured, credential-scoped IDs and display names:

```json
{"workspaces":[{"id":"default","displayName":"Default workspace"}]}
```

`GET /api/v1/models` returns configured model IDs, never provider credentials.

### Conversations and turns

Every conversation is bound to exactly one private Hotcell microVM at creation. The cell owns the Autopilot session (`autopilot-ai` JSON-RPC bridge), the `/workspace` volume seeded from the configured workspace's Git tree, and a scoped OpenRouter egress token (conversation model only, spend-capped, TTL-bound). Provider credentials never enter the cell image, its env, or its logs; only structured SDK events leave it. Server restart or cell pause never loses the session: on resume the bridge restores the same session ID from the cell volume, and the event cursor survives because it is journaled in the cell.

`POST /api/v1/conversations`

Requires an `Idempotency-Key` header (1-128 safe characters). The key is hashed with the credential ID and bound to one durable conversation/cell/session reservation before any Hotcell create call, so retries across timeouts and server restarts return the original conversation (`200`) instead of duplicating a cell, and reuse with different parameters returns `409 idempotency_conflict`. After an uncertain create (timeout between Hotcell create and record), the retry adopts the cell by its stable conversation label; the server never blindly creates a second cell.

```json
{"workspaceId":"default","model":"moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"}
```

Returns `201` with an opaque conversation ID and cursor; no filesystem paths or agent history:

```json
{"conversationId":"<uuid>","workspaceId":"default","model":"moonshotai/kimi-k2.6","status":"ready","activeRunId":null,"lastEventId":1,"createdAt":"...","updatedAt":"..."}
```

`GET /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}` resumes metadata by opaque ID. Conversation history remains server-side; Aster does not replay it on later requests.

`POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/turns`

The existing iOS client submits the legacy text-only shape, which remains supported:

```json
{"text":"Summarize the failing test and propose a fix."}
```

A legacy request returns `202` with `{conversationId,runId,status:"running"}`. Requests without `clientTurnId` are independent, non-idempotent submissions: the server never deduplicates by comparing text. Callers **must not automatically retry an ambiguous submission** (for example, after a timeout or lost response), because that may start a second turn. If another turn is still active, the request returns `409 conversation_busy`; after it finishes, another text-only submission is treated as a new turn, even if its text is identical.

New clients can opt into durable idempotency by including a stable `clientTurnId`:

```json
{"clientTurnId":"turn-550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000","text":"Summarize the failing test and propose a fix."}
```

`clientTurnId` is 1-128 ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `:`, or `-`, starting with a letter or digit, and is scoped to its conversation. Keep and resend the same ID for every retry of the same logical turn. The server compares the JSON-decoded `text` exactly for key reuse; it trims the text before appending it to the conversation and sending it to the model. Text is capped at 20,000 characters; request bodies are capped at 64 KiB. Workspace and model cannot be changed by a turn request.

The first accepted keyed request returns `202` with `{conversationId,clientTurnId,runId,status:"running"}` and stores that acceptance response, text, and run ID in SQLite in the same transaction that claims the conversation's active turn. Repeating the same ID and same text returns the original `202` response and run ID without appending another user message or starting another run, including after completion or restart. A restarted server marks uncertain work interrupted and does not replay it; a keyed retry still returns the original acceptance receipt, while conversation metadata/SSE reports current state. Reusing the ID with different text returns stable `409 idempotency_conflict`.

Only one active turn per conversation is allowed. A different, previously unused keyed request submitted while another turn is active returns `409 conversation_busy` and does not consume its ID; it may be retried after the active turn ends. An exact retry of an already accepted keyed request replays its response rather than returning busy. If `clientTurnId` is present but malformed (including `null`), the server returns `400 invalid_client_turn_id`; it never silently falls back to legacy mode.

`POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/cancel` is idempotent. It aborts the in-cell turn (`abort` RPC over the bridge), updates durable run state, cancels pending approvals, and returns the current conversation.

`POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/pause` suspends the cell. On microVM drivers (firecracker/applevz) Hotcell snapshots memory, so the Autopilot session resumes alive; on other drivers the workspace volume survives and the session is restored from it. Pause is only accepted at a safe boundary: with an active turn it returns `409 turn_active`. Turns submitted while paused return `409 conversation_paused`. Pausing is idempotent.

`POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/resume` restarts the cell, restores the same session ID from the cell volume, and returns to `ready`. Resuming a non-paused conversation is a no-op.

`DELETE /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}` revokes every scoped egress token through the Hotcell provider, destroys the cell and its volume, and poisons the original `Idempotency-Key` (`410 conversation_destroyed` on reuse). It cancels any active turn first. If token revocation or destruction fails, the mapping is marked `cleanup_pending` and the request returns `503`; retrying `DELETE` resumes cleanup. `DELETE` is idempotent (`200` when already destroyed).

All conversation routes require the creating credential: another credential scoped to the same workspace receives `404`.

### Events and reconnect

`GET /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/events` is SSE. Supply `Last-Event-ID: <sequence>` (or `?after=<sequence>`) to replay only later events. IDs are monotonic per conversation. Delivery is at-least-once: clients should de-duplicate by event ID. Reconnect with the last fully processed ID; replayed events are followed by live polling.

Example frames:

```text
id: 7
event: assistant.delta
data: {"delta":"I found the failing test."}

id: 8
event: tool.activity
data: {"tool":"edit","activity":"proposed"}

id: 9
event: approval.required
data: {"approvalId":"<uuid>","tool":"edit","explanation":"Edit src/example.ts in this workspace","expiresAt":...}

id: 10
event: usage
data: {"promptTokens":500,"completionTokens":40,"totalTokens":540,"costUsd":0.002}

id: 11
event: completed
data: {}
```

Tool events contain only names/status summaries, not raw arguments/results. Approval details are fetched separately after authentication. Terminal conversation states are `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `interrupted`; `waiting_approval` is nonterminal. On server restart, uncertain turns are marked interrupted and pending approvals expire; no action is replayed.

### Human approvals

`GET /api/v1/approvals/{approvalId}` returns the exact reviewable action/arguments and expiry. Secret-like payloads and paths outside the conversation worktree are rejected before an approval is created. The SSE `approval.required` event contains only the stable ID, tool name, concise explanation, and expiry.

`POST /api/v1/approvals/{approvalId}`

```json
{"decision":"allow"}
```

Use `deny` to reject. Decisions are single-use; repeating the same decision is idempotent, a conflicting decision returns `409 approval_already_resolved`, and expired approvals return `410 approval_expired`. Deny/expiry never execute the proposed tool action.

## Operations, retention, and rollback

- Service: `systemctl status autopilot`; logs: `journalctl -u autopilot`. Autopilot is a non-root systemd service with `Restart=on-failure`, loopback bind, and a health endpoint. Keep journald bounded (for example, an operator-approved `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/` cap); the current VM has no Autopilot-specific journald retention override.
- Before an upgrade, stop the service and make an offline backup of the Aster DB, run DB, sessions, worktrees, and workspace data. Encrypt the archive off-host with an operator-held `age` recipient; do not store a private decryption key on the VM.
- Roll back by stopping the service, checking out the previous known-good commit in `/opt/autopilot`, running `npm ci && npm run build`, and restarting. Keep the databases: schema changes are additive, and deleting them would lose conversations/approvals. Restore a backup only if the migration is incompatible, and restore the matching app version with it.
- The deployment smoke check must exercise create conversation, first turn, event replay, follow-up turn, approval resolution, and cancellation through an SSH tunnel. A one-turn health check alone is insufficient.

## Current operator setup gap

This runbook describes the required private path, but the inspected VM currently has no Tailscale client/enrollment. Until an operator enrolls the VM and iPhone into an approved tailnet and configures Serve (never Funnel), only the SSH-tunnel development path is available. Autopilot must remain loopback-bound in the meantime.
