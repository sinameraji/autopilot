## 1. What the paper did and found

The authors fixed a ReAct loop and varied three harness components, one at a time, across 176 matched settings (4 models × 2 benchmarks × context budgets of 32k/64k/96k/128k). Models: Nemotron-3 30B/120B/550B and Mistral-Medium-3.5-128B, all served via OpenRouter-priced tokens. Benchmarks: SWE-Bench Verified (500) and Terminal-Bench 2.1 (89). Success rates were compared with paired McNemar tests.

The three components:

| Component | Variants | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | on / off | `update_plan` tool holding a todo list. The current plan is **re-injected as a `<system-reminder>` before every model turn**, not appended to history. A reminder nags the model to plan first on non-trivial tasks. |
| Action space | predefined tools (read, write, edit, list, glob, grep, web_fetch, bash) / bash-only | Bash-only removes the file tools and the state tracking + diagnostics that ride on them. |
| Context management | Tiers T0–T4 | M1 **elision**: replace the body of stale tool observations in the *middle* of history with a stub. M2 **recall**: store elided originals, expose `recall_event(id)`. M3 **summarization**: fold the oldest middle events into a running summary via a tool-free call to the same model. T4 = staged: elide at soft threshold B1 = 0.6 × window, summarize at hard threshold B2 = 0.85 × window. Preamble and a recent window (0.3 × budget, at least 2 turns) stay verbatim. |

Fixed substrate (same in every arm): workspace path guard, **read-before-write with content hash**, allow/ask/deny permission layer, tool errors returned as observations, **post-edit diagnostics** (ruff / pyflakes / syntax check appended to the edit result), **stuck detection** (reminder after 5 byte-identical calls, terminate after 8 identical failing calls), tool results truncated at 24k chars, up to 8 read-only tools in parallel per step, 300-step cap.

Findings that transfer:

1. **Context management is mostly overflow prevention.** Managed-vs-T0 success gap on SWE-Bench: 35.7 → 15.9 → 5.5 → 2.7 points from 32k to 128k. T0 overflow rate fell from 78.7% (32k) to 8.7% (128k). Managed tiers never overflowed. Context management "extends trajectories without substantially altering behavior".
2. **Staged elision-then-summarization (T4) is the cheapest.** Similar accuracy to T1–T3, lowest cost in 7 of 8 model×benchmark panels, because cheap stubbing avoids most summarization calls.
3. **Recall is dead weight.** T2 vs T1: −0.36 points on average; 36 of 64 recall-enabled settings never called `recall_event`. Stronger models almost never use it. Making elision reversible added machinery for no accuracy.
4. **Planning is conditional.** Weakest model: +11.6 (SWE) / +4.5 (TB) points, at higher cost, because it stops the model abandoning tasks before editing (68.6% → 27.8% of runs ending without an edit). Strong models: no accuracy gain, but **~30% cost reduction** from trimming redundant post-edit verification (median trajectory 108 → 74 turns for 550B).
5. **Action space depends on capability and task type.** Weak model: predefined tools +15.0 / +10.1 points (bash-only runs died on out-of-interface tool emissions). Strongest model: **bash-only was better** (+3.6 / +5.6) *and* 53% / 30% cheaper, because it bundles several operations per command. Mistral split: full tools on SWE-Bench (+23.2), bash-only on Terminal-Bench (+6.7).
6. **Meta-lesson:** there is no universal harness. Pick components per model, task type, and budget, and validate with matched ablations plus trajectory-level analysis (phase labels: Localize / Reproduce / Fix / Verify / Other; earliest-failure-stage attribution).

## 2. Where Autopilot stands today

| Paper component | Autopilot today | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elision of stale observations | None in-history. Instead, `src/tools/reducer.ts` truncates **every** tool output at write time (grep 3k chars, read 4k, bash 4k, default 10k) and archives the raw output in the artifact store. | Reduction is applied to fresh observations too, which is the opposite of the paper's "keep recent verbatim, stub the stale middle". Caps are ~6× tighter than the paper's 24k. |
| Recall | `expand_artifact` tool (`src/tools/executor.ts:269`) plus heuristic `recallArtifacts` (`src/agent/artifact-compaction.ts:362`). | We carry recall machinery the paper found unused. Usage is unmeasured. |
| Summarization / compaction | Two paths: compiled-state compaction (`compactMessagesViaArtifacts`, keep last 4 turns, trigger at 80k tokens **or 12 turns**, `artifact-compaction.ts:265`) and LLM summarization (`llm-summarize.ts`, keep 4). Proactive threshold `min(80k, 0.75 × input budget)` (`context-budget.ts`). `KEEP_TURNS_LADDER = [4, 2, 1]`. | Thresholds are absolute, not budget-relative; the 12-turn trigger fires long before context pressure on large windows. No soft/hard staging. |
| Planning | `tasks_set` (`src/tools/tasks.ts`) drives a UI panel. System prompt (`system-prompt.ts:75`) requires `tasks_set` before **every** mutating tool. Plan lives only in history as a tool call; an auto-advance heuristic (`loop.ts:552`) patches the UI when the model forgets. | Plan is not re-injected per turn. After compaction it survives only as a `next_actions`-style line in the compiled session state (`artifact-compaction.ts:179-187`), and not at all on the LLM-summary path unless the summarizer happens to mention it. The "before every mutating tool" rule is far heavier than the paper's protocol and is a likely token/cost sink for strong models. Not gated by intent tier. |
| Action space | 28 tools in `ALL_TOOLS` (`src/tools/executor.ts:28`) always exposed, plus LSP/MCP tools. Code Mode (`execute_code`) redirects read/bash/grep/glob into a sandbox for up to 4 redirects per turn. Only a "research" worker profile narrows the set. | No capability-dependent profile. Strong models pay ~28 schemas of prompt tokens per request and are steered away from bundled bash. |
| Stuck detection | `loop.ts:528–546`: third identical call in a window of 8 is blocked with a reminder; one recovery per turn, then `AgentLoopError`. | Stricter than paper (5 / 8) and doesn't distinguish identical-successful from identical-failing calls. Reasonable; tune with data. |
| Post-edit diagnostics | LSP manager receives `notifyChange` after write/edit (`app.tsx:2003`) but **nothing is appended to the tool result**. | Missing. The paper treats this as fixed substrate for a reason: it lets the model fix syntax/undefined-name errors without burning a test run. |
| Read-before-write + hash | Not enforced by `edit`/`write` (`src/tools/edit.ts`). | Missing. Cheap to add; prevents clobbering externally modified files. |
| Tool errors as observations | `ToolError` (`src/tools/tool-error.ts`) returned to the model. | Matches. |
| Completion check | `completion-check.ts` asks an external judge ("jev") whether the turn really finished, nudges once. | No paper analogue. Keep; log its decisions (see companion plan). |
| Matched evaluation | None. No benchmark runner, no trajectory labelling. | This is the biggest gap: every change below is currently unmeasurable. |

## 3. Proposed changes

Ordered by expected value per unit of work. Each phase names the files it touches and how we will know it worked.

### Phase 0 — Headless evaluation harness (prerequisite)

Without this, phases 1–5 are opinions. The paper's whole contribution is that component effects flip sign across models.

- Add `scripts/eval/` (or `src/eval/`) that drives Autopilot in print/SDK mode (`src/print-mode.ts`, `src/sdk/`) over a task set, one worktree per task (`src/runs/worktrees.ts` already does this for workers).
- Task sources, in order of cheapness: (a) a 30–50 task slice of SWE-Bench Verified via the Harbor runner the paper used; (b) a hand-built "Autopilot-bench" of 20–30 tasks from this repo's own closed issues/PRs with their test commands (closest to our real distribution); (c) Terminal-Bench 2.1 later.
- Every harness knob below becomes an explicit config flag (`KimiConfig` in `src/config.ts` or an eval-only override object) so arms are matched.
- Output: one JSONL trajectory per run in the trace format from the companion plan, plus a summary table (success, cost from OpenRouter `usage.cost`, turns, overflow count, tool-call histogram).
- Paired comparison script: McNemar on success, mean cost, median turns.
- Exit criterion: can run the same 30 tasks on two models under two configs in under an afternoon.

### Phase 1 — Staged context management (T4 shape)

Goal: fewer `ContextBudgetError`s on small-window models, lower cost on large-window models, no accuracy loss.

1. **Budget-relative thresholds.** Replace the fixed `80_000` token / `12` turn triggers in `shouldCompact` and `PROACTIVE_COMPACTION_CAP_TOKENS` with soft `0.6 × effectiveInputBudget` and hard `0.85 × effectiveInputBudget`. Keep an absolute cap only as a cost control, configurable, default off for ≥128k windows.
2. **Elision pass before summarization.** New `elideStaleObservations(messages, budget)` in `src/agent/` that, when estimated tokens ≥ soft threshold, walks the *middle region* (everything after the system prompt / first user message and before the verbatim recent window of ≥ 2 turns or 0.3 × budget) and replaces bulky `tool` message bodies with a stub: `[tool output elided: N lines / M chars; re-run the tool if needed]`. Keep the `artifactId` in the stub so `expand_artifact` keeps working for now. Only when tokens are still ≥ hard threshold run the existing summarizer on the oldest middle turns.
3. **Loosen write-time reduction for fresh observations.** Raise `DEFAULT_REDUCER_CONFIG` caps toward the paper's 24k for `read`/`bash`/`grep` (experiment: 12k first), since stale copies will now be elided anyway. The reducer's structural work (outline, error-block extraction, dedupe) stays. Watch for regressions on small-window models; make caps a function of context window.
4. **Fire `PreCompact` before elision too** so the hook contract in `src/hooks/types.ts` stays honest.
5. **Measure recall.** Count `expand_artifact` calls and heuristic `recallArtifacts` hits per run in traces. If after Phase 0 runs they are as rare as the paper's `recall_event` (median 0), remove the heuristic recall injection and keep `expand_artifact` only as an opt-in tool, reclaiming prompt tokens and code.

Files: `src/agent/context-budget.ts`, `src/agent/artifact-compaction.ts`, `src/agent/llm-summarize.ts`, `src/agent/run-compact.ts`, `src/tools/reducer.ts`, `src/app.tsx` (auto-compaction call site), `src/sdk/`. Tests co-located; add a test that a 32k-window model running a 40-turn scripted session never throws `ContextBudgetError` and never summarizes before the hard threshold.

Success metric (Phase 0 harness): overflow failures → 0 on a 32k arm; cost per task on a 128k arm ≤ today's; success rate not significantly worse (McNemar).

### Phase 2 — Planning that is re-injected, lighter, and tier-gated

1. **Re-inject the live plan each turn.** Keep `tasks_set` as the write path, but before each model request append an ephemeral `<system-reminder>Current plan: …</system-reminder>` to the *end* of the request messages (not persisted, not in `messagesRef`). Append at the end so OpenRouter prompt caching of the stable prefix (`cacheStable` in `loop.ts:430`) is unaffected. This also makes the plan independent of compaction, which today keeps at most a one-line digest of it.
2. **Relax the protocol.** Replace the system-prompt rule "MUST call `tasks_set` immediately before each new step and after completing each step … Do not execute mutating tools without updating task progress first" with the paper's protocol: plan first on ~3+ step tasks, keep exactly one `in_progress`, mark completed when done, skip on trivial requests. Keep the auto-advance heuristic as the safety net for the UI.
3. **Gate by tier and model.** Use the existing intent classifier (`src/intent/classify.ts`: light / medium / heavy) and model tier: no plan reminder for `light`; for strong models, plan nudging only on `heavy`. Expose as config so Phase 0 can A/B it.
4. **Verification budget.** The paper's cost win for strong models came from trimming redundant post-edit verification. Add a soft reminder when the model has run ≥ N test/verification commands after its last edit with no new edits ("You have verified this change N times with no new changes; finish or state what is still uncertain").

Files: `src/agent/system-prompt.ts`, `src/agent/loop.ts` (request assembly), `src/tools/tasks.ts`, `src/intent/`. Metric: for a strong model, median turns and cost per task drop with no success loss; for a weak model, fraction of runs ending with zero edits drops.

### Phase 3 — Model-dependent tool profiles

1. Introduce named tool profiles in `src/tools/executor.ts` beside `getWorkerTools`: `full` (today's `ALL_TOOLS`), `lean` (bash, read, edit, write, tasks_set, memory_*, subagent, github_create_pr), and `bash-first` (bash, edit, write, tasks_set) for eval only.
2. Select by model capability: a per-model `toolProfile` hint in `src/models/` (seeded for the frontier models; default `full`) and a user override in config.
3. Interactive caveat: in the TUI every `bash` call can prompt. A `lean` profile only pays off together with a sensible read-only allowlist in `src/permissions-evaluator.ts` (the paper's harness auto-allowed `git status/diff/log`, `ls`, `rg`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`). Autopilot already classifies read-only commands; make sure the lean profile ships with that allowlist on.
4. Measure out-of-interface tool emissions (model calls a tool that is not exposed) per run; this is the paper's signature of a model that needs the full profile.

Files: `src/tools/executor.ts`, `src/models/`, `src/config.ts`, `src/permissions-evaluator.ts`. Metric: for frontier models, tool calls per task and cost drop; success unchanged. For small OpenRouter models, keep `full`.

### Phase 4 — Fixed substrate the paper had and we lack

1. **Post-edit diagnostics.** After a successful `edit`/`write`, append a compact diagnostics block to the tool result: LSP diagnostics for that file when a server is up (`src/lsp/manager.ts`, with a short debounce), else a language-specific fast check (`node --check` / esbuild transform for JS/TS, `python -m py_compile` / `ruff` if present, `go vet` single package). Cap at the reducer's lsp limits. Make it opt-out.
2. **Read-before-write with content hash.** Track `{path → sha256 at last read/write}` in the tool executor for the session. `edit` refuses when the file has never been read this session, or when its hash changed since (external modification), returning a `ToolError` that tells the model to re-read. Allow `write` to create new files freely.
3. **Stuck detection tuning.** Split `LOOP_THRESHOLD` into identical-any (reminder) and identical-failing (terminate) thresholds, both configurable, and log every trip (companion plan). Current defaults are stricter than the paper's; keep them until traces say otherwise.

Files: `src/tools/edit.ts`, `src/tools/write.ts`, `src/tools/executor.ts`, `src/lsp/manager.ts`, `src/agent/loop.ts`. Metric: fewer wasted test runs after syntax-broken edits; fewer "edit old_string not found" retries.

### Phase 5 — Trajectory analytics

Port the paper's annotation schemes so we can explain *why* a number moved, not just that it moved:

- Rule-based first pass from tool names (read/grep/glob → Localize; edit on repo file → Fix; bash matching test runners → Verify; create/run a repro file → Reproduce) over trace JSONL.
- Optional LLM-judge pass with the paper's Figure 40–42 prompts for ambiguous bash commands (Terminal-Bench style 10-symbol taxonomy: I S C M E X T V N G).
- Failure-stage attribution for unresolved runs: file localization → line localization → patch → verification, earliest-failure convention.
- Report: survival curve of active runs per turn by phase, fraction of runs ending without an edit, re-patch rate, verification turns after last edit.

This is the same tooling the companion plan needs to filter and weight traces for post-training.

---

## 4. Things the paper argues *against* doing

- Don't invest further in recoverable elision (recall). Measure `expand_artifact` first; expect to shrink it.
- Don't adopt a single "best" harness for all models. OpenRouter users run everything from 8B to frontier models; the profile must follow the model.
- Don't assume planning is free. For strong models it is a cost lever, not an accuracy lever, and the current "before every mutating tool" rule is likely net negative for them.
- Don't treat context management as a quality feature on large windows. On 128k+ windows the gap was 2.7 points; the lever there is cost.

## 5. Caveats when transferring results

- Paper tasks are single-shot, non-interactive, Python-only. Autopilot sessions are multi-turn with a human in the loop, permission prompts, and mixed languages. Phase 0 should include our own task set for that reason.
- Temperature 0, 300-step cap, 16k output cap per turn in the paper; Autopilot defaults differ (`DEFAULT_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 16_384` matches).
- "Bash-only" in the paper bundled the loss of state tracking and diagnostics; a lean profile here should keep diagnostics (Phase 4) attached to `edit`/`write`.
- Effects were measured once per task; Terminal-Bench contrasts were mostly directional. Expect noise; use paired tests.

## 6. Suggested order and rough sizing

| Phase | Size | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 Eval harness | 3–5 days | trace format from companion plan |
| 1 Staged context mgmt | 2–3 days | 0 |
| 4.1 Post-edit diagnostics, 4.2 read-before-write | 1–2 days | none |
| 2 Planning | 1–2 days | 0 |
| 3 Tool profiles | 2 days | 0, 4 |
| 5 Trajectory analytics | 2–3 days | 0 |
