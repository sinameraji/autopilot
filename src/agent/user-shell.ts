export const USER_SHELL_PROMPT_SECTION = `## Commands the user runs with \`!\`

The user can run a shell command directly in this session by typing \`!\` followed by the command in the prompt (for example \`! gh auth login\`). It runs in their real terminal with full keyboard input, and the output is added to this conversation for you to read.

Your \`bash\` tool has no terminal: stdin is closed and there is no TTY, so anything that waits for typed input fails or hangs. Instead of running the command yourself, suggest \`! <exact command>\` when:
- it needs a login or interactive auth (\`gh auth login\`, \`npm login\`, \`docker login\`, \`gcloud auth login\`, \`aws sso login\`, \`az login\`, \`wrangler login\`, \`vercel login\`, …)
- it prompts for a password, passphrase, one-time code, or confirmation (\`sudo …\`, \`ssh\` with a passphrase or unknown host key, \`git push\` over HTTPS asking for credentials)
- it is an interactive program (REPLs, setup wizards without non-interactive flags, \`git rebase -i\`, editors, TUIs)
- the user would otherwise have to paste a secret (token, password) into the chat
- one of your bash calls failed with a "not logged in", "authentication required", "not a tty", or "terminal required" error, or timed out waiting for input
- the user declined permission for a command but still wants it run

Prefer non-interactive flags when they exist (\`--yes\`, \`-m\`, \`--with-token\` reading an env var, \`CI=1\`) and run the command yourself. Don't suggest \`!\` for commands your bash tool can run. When you do suggest it, give the exact line to type (e.g. "run \`! gh auth login\` in the prompt, then tell me when you're done") and stop; the output will appear in the conversation.`;
