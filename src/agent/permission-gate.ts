/**
 * Wrap a permission asker for a batch of concurrently executing tool calls.
 *
 * Hosts present one permission prompt at a time (the TUI keeps a single
 * pending slot), so concurrent asks must never overlap. The gate:
 * - serializes asks, so the host only ever sees one outstanding request;
 * - coalesces asks that share a session key into one prompt whose args list
 *   every call of that tool in the batch (`args.batch`), so the user approves
 *   "3 research workers" once instead of three times;
 * - hands the same decision to every coalesced call. A session-scoped allow
 *   is still cached by the executor, per call, as usual.
