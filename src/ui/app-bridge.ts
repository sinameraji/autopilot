/**
 * The contract between the App (all of autopilot's interactive logic) and an
 * alternative view such as the Camouflage renderer.
 *
 * With a bridge, App runs exactly as it does under Ink (same state, managers,
 * slash commands, turn handling) but renders nothing itself. After every
 * render it reports a snapshot of what's on screen via `sync`, and it hands
 * the view a set of actions (submit text, interrupt, answer a picker) via
 * `connect`. The view decides how to draw the snapshot and when to call the
 * actions. Anything added to App later reaches the view without changes here.
